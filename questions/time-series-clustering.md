## 1. What is time series analysis, and what are its key components?

**Answer**:

**Time series analysis** involves studying data points collected over time to identify patterns, forecast future values, or understand underlying structures.

- **Key Components**:
  - **Trend**: Long-term increase or decrease (e.g., rising sales over years).
  - **Seasonality**: Repeating patterns at fixed intervals (e.g., holiday sales spikes).
  - **Cyclical Patterns**: Longer, non-fixed fluctuations (e.g., economic cycles).
  - **Noise**: Random variations (e.g., unpredictable daily fluctuations).
  - **Level**: Baseline value without trend/seasonality.

- **Goals**:
  - Forecasting (e.g., predict stock prices).
  - Anomaly detection (e.g., detect server outages).
  - Decomposition (e.g., separate trend from seasonality).

- **Techniques**:
  - Statistical: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.
  - ML: LSTM, Prophet.
  - Decomposition: STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition).

**Example**:
- Data: Monthly sales.
- Analysis: Identify upward trend, December spikes (seasonality), random noise.

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify components: “Trend, seasonality, noise are core.”
- Mention use cases: “Forecasting and anomaly detection.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show trend + seasonal curve.”

## 2. What is the difference between AR, MA, and ARIMA models?

**Answer**:

- **AR (AutoRegressive)**:
  - **How**: Models value at time `t` as a linear combination of past values.
  - **Formula**: `y_t = c + φ_1*y_{t-1} + ... + φ_p*y_{t-p} + ε_t`.
  - **Order**: `p` (lags).
  - **Use Case**: Predict stock prices with momentum.
  - **Intuition**: “Past values predict future.”

- **MA (Moving Average)**:
  - **How**: Models value as a linear combination of past errors.
  - **Formula**: `y_t = c + ε_t + θ_1*ε_{t-1} + ... + θ_q*ε_{t-q}`.
  - **Order**: `q` (error lags).
  - **Use Case**: Smooth noisy series (e.g., temperature).
  - **Intuition**: “Corrects based on past surprises.”

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**:
  - **How**: Combines AR and MA, with differencing to handle non-stationarity.
  - **Formula**: ARIMA(p,d,q) where `d` is differencing order.
    - `p`: AR terms.
    - `d`: Differencing to make stationary.
    - `q`: MA terms.
  - **Use Case**: Forecast sales with trend and noise.
  - **Intuition**: “AR + MA, adjusted for trends.”

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Scope**: AR uses past values, MA uses past errors, ARIMA combines both + differencing.
  - **Stationarity**: AR/MA assume stationarity; ARIMA handles non-stationary via `d`.
  - **Complexity**: ARIMA is more flexible but harder to tune.

**Example**:
- AR(1): `y_t = 0.5*y_{t-1} + ε_t` (simple trend).
- MA(1): `y_t = ε_t + 0.3*ε_{t-1}` (noise smoothing).
- ARIMA(1,1,1): Differences data, combines AR and MA.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain terms: “AR for values, MA for errors.”
- Mention stationarity: “ARIMA’s `d` fixes trends.”
- Be ready to derive: “Show ARIMA(p,d,q) equation.”

## 3. What is stationarity, and why is it important in time series analysis?

**Answer**:

**Stationarity** means a time series’ statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) are constant over time.

- **Types**:
  - **Strict Stationarity**: All moments are time-invariant (rarely used).
  - **Weak Stationarity**: Constant mean, variance, and autocovariance.

- **Why Important**:
  - **Model Assumptions**: Many models (e.g., AR, MA) assume stationarity for valid predictions.
  - **Predictability**: Stationary series have stable patterns, easier to forecast.
  - **Simplifies Analysis**: Removes trends/seasonality for modeling.

- **Testing**:
  - **Visual**: Plot series, check for trends/seasonality.
  - **Statistical Tests**:
    - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF): Null hypothesis is non-stationary.
    - KPSS: Null is stationary.
  - **Autocorrelation**: Check ACF plot for decay.

- **Achieving Stationarity**:
  - **Differencing**: Subtract `y_{t-1}` from `y_t` (e.g., ARIMA’s `d`).
  - **Transformations**: Log, square root to stabilize variance.
  - **Detrending**: Remove linear/polynomial trend.
  - **Deseasonalizing**: Subtract seasonal component.

**Example**:
- Series: Stock prices (trending, non-stationary).
- Fix: Difference once, ADF p-value < 0.05 → stationary.

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify definition: “Constant mean and variance.”
- Emphasize models: “ARIMA needs it for AR/MA parts.”
- Be ready to test: “Explain ADF test intuition.”

## 4. What are some common methods for handling missing values in time series data?

**Answer**:

Handling missing values in time series maintains temporal structure and avoids bias. Common methods:

- **Forward Fill**:
  - Use last observed value: `y_t = y_{t-1}`.
  - Pros: Simple, preserves trends.
  - Cons: Assumes stability, poor for long gaps.
- **Backward Fill**:
  - Use next observed value: `y_t = y_{t+1}`.
  - Pros: Works if future data is available.
  - Cons: Not real-time, same limits as forward.
- **Linear Interpolation**:
  - Estimate between points: `y_t = y_{t-1} + (y_{t+1} - y_{t-1}) * (t - t-1)/(t+1 - t-1)`.
  - Pros: Smooth, captures trends.
  - Cons: Assumes linearity, fails for non-linear patterns.
- **Spline/Polynomial Interpolation**:
  - Fit smooth curve to gaps.
  - Pros: Handles non-linear patterns.
  - Cons: Risk of overfitting, complex.
- **Model-Based Imputation**:
  - Use time series model (e.g., ARIMA, Kalman filter) to predict missing values.
  - Pros: Respects temporal structure.
  - Cons: Computationally intensive, model-dependent.
- **Mean/Median Imputation**:
  - Use series mean or median.
  - Pros: Simple, stable.
  - Cons: Ignores temporal patterns, adds bias.
- **Domain-Specific**:
  - Use external data (e.g., weather for temperature gaps).
  - Pros: Accurate if correlated.
  - Cons: Needs extra data.

**Example**:
- Data: Hourly sensor readings, 5% missing.
- Method: Linear interpolation for short gaps, ARIMA for longer gaps.

**Interview Tips**:
- Prioritize temporal: “Time series needs context, not just means.”
- Suggest trade-offs: “Interpolation is fast, models are accurate.”
- Be ready to code: “Describe interpolation logic.”

## 5. What is the difference between clustering and classification?

**Answer**:

- **Clustering**:
  - **Type**: Unsupervised learning.
  - **Goal**: Group similar data points into clusters without labels.
  - **How**: Optimize similarity (e.g., minimize distance within clusters).
  - **Output**: Cluster assignments (e.g., group 1, group 2).
  - **Example**: Segment customers by behavior.
  - **Algorithms**: K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical.

- **Classification**:
  - **Type**: Supervised learning.
  - **Goal**: Predict predefined class labels for data points.
  - **How**: Train on labeled data to minimize prediction error.
  - **Output**: Class labels (e.g., spam/not spam).
  - **Example**: Classify emails as spam.
  - **Algorithms**: Logistic regression, SVM, neural networks.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Labels**: Clustering has none; classification uses labeled data.
  - **Objective**: Clustering finds structure; classification predicts labels.
  - **Evaluation**: Clustering uses internal metrics (e.g., silhouette); classification uses accuracy, F1.
  - **Use Case**: Clustering for exploration; classification for prediction.

**Example**:
- Clustering: Group users by purchase patterns (no labels).
- Classification: Predict if user will buy (yes/no, labeled).

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify supervision: “Clustering is unsupervised, classification supervised.”
- Mention metrics: “Silhouette for clustering, F1 for classification.”
- Be ready to compare: “Clustering to explore, classification to decide.”

## 6. What are the different types of clustering algorithms?

**Answer**:

Clustering algorithms group data based on similarity, differing in approach and assumptions:

- **Centroid-Based**:
  - **How**: Assign points to clusters based on distance to centroids.
  - **Example**: K-means.
    - Minimize within-cluster variance.
    - Iteratively update centroids.
  - **Pros**: Fast, scalable.
  - **Cons**: Assumes spherical clusters, needs `k`.
- **Hierarchical**:
  - **How**: Build tree of clusters (dendrogram) via merging (agglomerative) or splitting (divisive).
  - **Example**: Agglomerative clustering.
    - Use linkage (e.g., single, complete).
  - **Pros**: No need for `k`, captures hierarchy.
  - **Cons**: Slow for large data, sensitive to noise.
- **Density-Based**:
  - **How**: Group points in dense regions, ignore sparse areas.
  - **Example**: DBSCAN.
    - Core points, border points, noise.
  - **Pros**: Finds arbitrary shapes, handles outliers.
  - **Cons**: Struggles with varying densities, parameter-sensitive.
- **Distribution-Based**:
  - **How**: Assume data follows a distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
  - **Example**: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
    - Fit mixture of Gaussians using EM.
  - **Pros**: Probabilistic, flexible shapes.
  - **Cons**: Computationally heavy, assumes distribution.
- **Graph-Based**:
  - **How**: Treat data as graph, cluster via connectivity.
  - **Example**: Spectral clustering.
    - Use eigenvalues of similarity matrix.
  - **Pros**: Captures complex structures.
  - **Cons**: Scales poorly, needs similarity metric.

**Example**:
- Data: Customer purchases.
- K-means: 3 spherical groups.
- DBSCAN: Irregular groups, outliers ignored.

**Interview Tips**:
- Categorize clearly: “Centroid, hierarchical, density, etc.”
- Discuss trade-offs: “K-means is fast, DBSCAN finds shapes.”
- Be ready to suggest: “DBSCAN for noisy data, GMM for soft clusters.”

## 7. How do you choose the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering?

**Answer**:

Choosing the optimal number of clusters (`k`) in k-means balances fit and complexity. Methods:

- **Elbow Method**:
  - **How**: Plot within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) vs. `k`.
  - **Logic**: WSS decreases as `k` increases; look for “elbow” where adding clusters yields diminishing returns.
  - **Pros**: Simple, visual.
  - **Cons**: Subjective, no clear elbow sometimes.
- **Silhouette Score**:
  - **How**: Measure cohesion (distance to own cluster) vs. separation (distance to others).
  - **Formula**: `s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))`, where `a(i)` is intra-cluster distance, `b(i)` is nearest other cluster.
  - **Logic**: Maximize average silhouette score (range [-1, 1]).
  - **Pros**: Quantifies quality, less subjective.
  - **Cons**: Computationally intensive for large data.
- **Gap Statistic**:
  - **How**: Compare WSS to expected WSS under null distribution (random data).
  - **Logic**: Choose `k` where gap is largest (real clusters vs. noise).
  - **Pros**: Statistically grounded.
  - **Cons**: Complex, requires null sampling.
- **Domain Knowledge**:
  - **How**: Use business context (e.g., 3 customer segments expected).
  - **Pros**: Practical, interpretable.
  - **Cons**: Not data-driven.
- **Cross-Validation**:
  - **How**: Split data, evaluate clustering stability for different `k`.
  - **Pros**: Robust.
  - **Cons**: Less common, high compute.

**Example**:
- Data: User activity logs.
- Elbow: Suggests `k=3` (sharp bend).
- Silhouette: Confirms `k=3` (score = 0.6 vs. 0.4 for `k=4`).

**Interview Tips**:
- Prioritize elbow/silhouette: “Most common in practice.”
- Explain intuition: “Balance fit and simplicity.”
- Be ready to plot: “Show WSS curve with elbow.”

## 8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of hierarchical clustering?

**Answer**:

- **Advantages**:
  - **No Need for `k`**: Number of clusters chosen post-hoc via dendrogram cut.
  - **Hierarchical Structure**: Captures nested relationships (e.g., sub-groups within clusters).
  - **Flexible Linkage**: Options like single, complete, average linkage suit different data.
  - **Visualizable**: Dendrogram shows merging process, aids interpretation.
  - **Deterministic**: No randomness (unlike k-means initialization).

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Scalability**: `O(n²)` or `O(n³)` complexity, slow for large datasets.
  - **Sensitive to Noise**: Outliers can distort merges (e.g., single linkage chains).
  - **Irreversible**: Merging decisions can’t be undone, leading to suboptimal clusters.
  - **Memory Intensive**: Stores distance matrix, impractical for big data.
  - **Linkage Choice**: Results vary with linkage (e.g., single vs. complete), needs tuning.

**Example**:
- Data: Gene expression (500 samples).
- Advantage: Dendrogram shows biological hierarchies.
- Disadvantage: Takes 10 mins vs. k-means’ 1 min.

**Interview Tips**:
- Highlight dendrogram: “Great for visualizing structure.”
- Discuss limits: “Not for big data due to speed.”
- Be ready to compare: “Vs. k-means: slower but no `k` needed.”
