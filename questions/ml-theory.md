## 1. Explain how cross-validation works

**Question**: [Amazon] Describe the process of cross-validation and its purpose in machine learning.

**Answer**:

**Cross-validation** is a technique used to evaluate a machine learning modelâ€™s performance on unseen data, ensuring it generalizes well and isnâ€™t overfitting to the training set. It works by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on some subsets, and testing it on others, repeating this process to get a robust estimate of performance.

The most common form is **k-fold cross-validation**:

1. **Split**: Divide the dataset into `k` equal-sized folds (e.g., `k=5` or `k=10`).
2. **Iterate**: For each fold:
   - Use `k-1` folds for training and the remaining fold for validation.
   - Train the model on the training folds and evaluate it (e.g., using accuracy, MSE) on the validation fold.
3. **Average**: Compute the average performance metric (and standard deviation) across all `k` folds to estimate the modelâ€™s generalization ability.

**Purpose**:
- **Generalization**: Assess how well the model performs on unseen data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Compare different models or parameters to select the best configuration.
- **Robustness**: Reduce the risk of overfitting by testing on multiple validation sets.

**Example**:
For a dataset with 100 samples and 5-fold CV:
- Each fold has 20 samples.
- Train on 80 samples, test on 20, repeat 5 times.
- Average the accuracy scores (e.g., [0.85, 0.87, 0.84, 0.86, 0.88] â†’ mean = 0.86).

**Variations**:
- **Stratified k-fold**: Ensures class distribution is preserved in each fold (useful for imbalanced data).
- **Leave-One-Out (LOO)**: Uses `k = n` (n = number of samples), computationally expensive.
- **Hold-out**: A single train-test split (less robust but faster).

**Interview Tips**:
- Mention trade-offs: Higher `k` gives better estimates but is computationally costly.
- Explain why itâ€™s better than a single train-test split (reduces variance in performance metrics).
- Note edge cases, like ensuring stratification for classification tasks.

## 2. How do you handle imbalanced labels in classification models

**Question**: [Etsy] Discuss techniques to address imbalanced labels in classification models and their trade-offs.

**Answer**:

Imbalanced labels occur when one class dominates the dataset (e.g., 90% negative, 10% positive), causing models to bias toward the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class. Here are common techniques to handle this, with trade-offs:

1. **Resampling Techniques**:
   - **Oversampling** (e.g., SMOTE):
     - **How**: Generate synthetic samples for the minority class (e.g., SMOTE interpolates new points).
     - **Pros**: Increases minority class representation without losing data.
     - **Cons**: Risk of overfitting (synthetic data may not reflect real-world distribution); computationally expensive.
   - **Undersampling**:
     - **How**: Randomly remove samples from the majority class.
     - **Pros**: Reduces dataset size, faster training.
     - **Cons**: Loss of information, may discard useful data.
   - **Trade-off**: Oversampling preserves data but risks overfitting; undersampling is simpler but sacrifices information.

2. **Class Weights**:
   - **How**: Assign higher weights to the minority class in the loss function (e.g., `weight = 1 / frequency`).
   - **Pros**: No data modification, easy to implement in libraries like Scikit-Learn (`class_weight='balanced'`).
   - **Cons**: May not suffice for extreme imbalances; requires model support.
   - **Example**: In logistic regression, penalize misclassifying the minority class more heavily.

3. **Anomaly Detection Approach**:
   - **How**: Treat the minority class as anomalies and use algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM.
   - **Pros**: Effective for extreme imbalances (e.g., fraud detection).
   - **Cons**: May not generalize to all classification tasks; requires rethinking the problem.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **How**: Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC instead of accuracy, which can be misleading.
   - **Pros**: Better reflects performance on the minority class.
   - **Cons**: Requires careful interpretation (e.g., trade-off between precision and recall).
   - **Example**: AUC-ROC evaluates model performance across thresholds, less sensitive to imbalance.

5. **Data Collection**:
   - **How**: Gather more data for the minority class if possible.
   - **Pros**: Addresses the root cause, improves model robustness.
   - **Cons**: Often infeasible due to cost or availability.

**Practical Example**:
For a fraud detection dataset (1% fraud, 99% non-fraud):
- Apply SMOTE to oversample fraud cases.
- Use class weights in a Random Forest model.
- Evaluate with F1-score and AUC-ROC to ensure minority class performance.

**Interview Tips**:
- Emphasize that the choice depends on the problem (e.g., SMOTE for moderate imbalance, anomaly detection for extreme cases).
- Discuss trade-offs (e.g., oversampling vs. undersampling).
- Mention real-world constraints, like computational resources or data availability.

## 3. What is the bias-variance trade-off?

**Question**: [McKinsey] Explain the bias-variance trade-off and its implications for model selection.

**Answer**:

The **bias-variance trade-off** is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the balance between a modelâ€™s ability to fit the training data (bias) and its sensitivity to variations in the data (variance). It helps explain why models overfit or underfit and guides model selection.

- **Bias**:
  - Measures how much a modelâ€™s predictions deviate from the true values due to oversimplification.
  - **High bias**: Model is too simple (e.g., linear regression on non-linear data), leading to underfitting.
  - **Example**: Predicting house prices with a constant value ignores patterns, resulting in high error.

- **Variance**:
  - Measures how much a modelâ€™s predictions vary with different training sets.
  - **High variance**: Model is too complex (e.g., a deep neural network with few data points), overfitting to noise.
  - **Example**: A decision tree that memorizes training data performs poorly on new data.

- **Trade-off**:
  - Simplifying a model reduces variance but increases bias.
  - Complicating a model reduces bias but increases variance.
  - The goal is to find the **sweet spot** where total error (bias + variance + irreducible error) is minimized.

**Mathematical Intuition**:
Expected error = (Bias)Â² + Variance + Irreducible Error
- **BiasÂ²**: Systematic error from model assumptions.
- **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to training data.
- **Irreducible Error**: Noise inherent in the data, unavoidable.

**Implications for Model Selection**:
- **Simple Models** (e.g., linear regression):
  - High bias, low variance.
  - Good for small datasets or when interpretability matters.
  - Risk: Underfitting if data is complex.
- **Complex Models** (e.g., deep neural networks):
  - Low bias, high variance.
  - Good for large, complex datasets.
  - Risk: Overfitting without enough data or regularization.
- **Techniques to Balance**:
  - **Regularization**: (e.g., L1/L2) reduces variance by penalizing complexity.
  - **Cross-validation**: Estimates generalization error to choose the right complexity.
  - **Ensemble Methods**: (e.g., Random Forest) combine models to reduce variance while keeping bias low.

**Practical Example**:
For a dataset with non-linear patterns:
- A linear model (high bias) may underfit, missing trends.
- A deep decision tree (high variance) may overfit to noise.
- A Random Forest with tuned depth balances bias and variance, achieving better generalization.

**Interview Tips**:
- Draw the bias-variance curve (error vs. model complexity) if possible.
- Relate to real algorithms (e.g., linear models vs. neural networks).
- Mention practical solutions like regularization or more data to reduce variance.
