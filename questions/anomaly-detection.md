## 1. What is anomaly detection, and what are its common applications?

**Answer**:

**Anomaly detection** identifies data points, events, or patterns that deviate significantly from expected behavior, also known as outliers or novelties.

- **Types**:
  - **Point Anomalies**: Single data point deviates (e.g., unusual transaction).
  - **Contextual Anomalies**: Deviates in context (e.g., high temp in winter).
  - **Collective Anomalies**: Group deviates (e.g., network attack pattern).

- **Common Applications**:
  - **Fraud Detection**: Spot unusual credit card transactions.
  - **Cybersecurity**: Detect intrusions or malware.
  - **Healthcare**: Identify abnormal patient vitals (e.g., ECG spikes).
  - **Industrial Monitoring**: Flag machine failures (e.g., sensor outliers).
  - **Finance**: Monitor stock market irregularities.
  - **ML Context**: Clean datasets, improve model robustness.

- **Approaches**:
  - Statistical (e.g., z-score).
  - ML (e.g., Isolation Forest, autoencoders).
  - Rule-based (e.g., thresholds).

**Example**:
- Task: Detect fraud.
- Anomaly: $10,000 transaction vs. usual $100.

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify types: “Point, contextual, collective matter.”
- Link to domains: “Fraud and security are big.”
- Be ready to list: “Name 3-5 use cases.”

## 2. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection?

**Answer**:

- **Supervised Anomaly Detection**:
  - **How**: Train model on labeled data (normal vs. anomalous).
  - **Process**:
    - Dataset: Examples of both classes (e.g., 99% normal, 1% fraud).
    - Model: Classifier (e.g., SVM, neural net).
    - Predict: Classify new points as normal/anomalous.
  - **Pros**:
    - High accuracy with good labels.
    - Leverages known patterns.
  - **Cons**:
    - Needs labeled data (rare for anomalies).
    - Imbalanced classes (few anomalies).
  - **Use Case**: Fraud detection with historical labels.

- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**:
  - **How**: Identify anomalies without labels, assuming most data is normal.
  - **Process**:
    - Model: Learn normal patterns (e.g., clustering, autoencoders).
    - Flag: Points deviating from normal (e.g., high reconstruction error).
  - **Pros**:
    - No labels needed, widely applicable.
    - Handles unseen anomalies.
  - **Cons**:
    - Harder to tune thresholds.
    - May miss subtle anomalies.
  - **Use Case**: Industrial monitoring with no prior failures.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Labels**: Supervised uses them; unsupervised doesn’t.
  - **Data**: Supervised needs balanced labels; unsupervised assumes normal majority.
  - **Flexibility**: Unsupervised for new anomalies; supervised for known ones.
  - **ML Context**: Unsupervised is common due to label scarcity.

**Example**:
- Supervised: Train SVM on labeled fraud data.
- Unsupervised: Use Isolation Forest on unlabeled sensor data.

**Interview Tips**:
- Highlight labels: “Supervised needs costly annotations.”
- Discuss trade-offs: “Unsupervised is flexible but noisier.”
- Be ready to suggest: “Unsupervised for new systems.”

## 3. How would you use statistical methods for anomaly detection?

**Answer**:

Statistical methods identify anomalies by modeling data distributions and flagging points with low probability.

- **Methods**:
  - **Z-Score**:
    - **How**: Compute `z = (x - μ) / σ`, where `μ` is mean, `σ` is std dev.
    - **Threshold**: Flag if `|z| > 3` (e.g., >3 std devs).
    - **Use**: Univariate, normal-like data.
  - **Percentiles**:
    - **How**: Flag points outside extreme percentiles (e.g., <1% or >99%).
    - **Use**: Non-parametric, skewed data.
  - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**:
    - **How**: Fit multiple Gaussians, compute likelihood.
    - **Threshold**: Low `P(x)` = anomaly.
    - **Use**: Multivariate, complex distributions.
  - **Grubbs’ Test**:
    - **How**: Test for single outlier in normal data.
    - **Use**: Small datasets.
  - **Mahalanobis Distance**:
    - **How**: Measure distance accounting for covariance: `D = √((x-μ)^T Σ^-1 (x-μ))`.
    - **Threshold**: High `D` = anomaly.
    - **Use**: Multivariate normal data.

- **Steps**:
  1. Model data (e.g., fit Gaussian).
  2. Compute anomaly score (e.g., z-score, likelihood).
  3. Set threshold (e.g., 99th percentile).
  4. Flag outliers.

- **Pros**:
  - Interpretable, mathematically grounded.
  - Works with small data.
- **Cons**:
  - Assumes distribution (e.g., normality).
  - Struggles with high dimensions.

**Example**:
- Data: Server response times.
- Z-Score: Flag time with `z > 3` (e.g., 5s vs. mean 1s).

**Interview Tips**:
- Start simple: “Z-score is intuitive baseline.”
- Mention limits: “Normality assumption often fails.”
- Be ready to compute: “Show z-score formula.”

## 4. What is the Isolation Forest algorithm, and how does it work?

**Answer**:

**Isolation Forest** is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning data, leveraging that anomalies are easier to isolate.

- **How It Works**:
  - **Concept**: Anomalies have fewer neighbors, require fewer splits to isolate.
  - **Process**:
    1. **Build Trees**:
       - Create multiple random trees.
       - For each tree:
         - Randomly select feature.
         - Randomly split between min/max values.
         - Repeat until points are isolated or max depth.
    2. **Path Length**:
       - Measure depth to isolate each point.
       - Anomalies have shorter paths (fewer splits).
    3. **Score**:
       - Average path length across trees.
       - Normalize: `score ≈ 1` (anomaly), `≈ 0` (normal).
  - **Math**: Score = `2^(-E(h(x))/c(n))`, where `E(h(x))` is avg path length, `c(n)` is avg path for `n` points.

- **Pros**:
  - Fast, scales to large datasets (`O(n log n)`).
  - Handles high dimensions.
  - No distribution assumptions.
- **Cons**:
  - Random splits may miss complex anomalies.
  - Less interpretable than statistical methods.

**Example**:
- Data: Network traffic.
- Isolation Forest: Flags packet with short path (e.g., 2 splits vs. 10).

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain intuition: “Anomalies are quick to isolate.”
- Compare: “Vs. DBSCAN: faster, less parameter tuning.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show tree splitting point.”

## 5. Explain the concept of autoencoders for anomaly detection

**Answer**:

**Autoencoders** are neural networks trained to reconstruct input data, used for anomaly detection by flagging points with high reconstruction error.

- **How They Work**:
  - **Architecture**:
    - Encoder: Compress input `x` to latent space `z` (e.g., `z = f(x)`).
    - Decoder: Reconstruct `x'` from `z` (e.g., `x' = g(z)`).
    - Bottleneck: `z` has lower dimension, forces learning.
  - **Training**:
    - Minimize loss: `L = ||x - x'||²` (MSE).
    - Train on normal data to learn typical patterns.
  - **Detection**:
    - Compute reconstruction error: `error = ||x - x'||²`.
    - Threshold: High error = anomaly (poorly reconstructed).
  - **Variants**:
    - Variational Autoencoder (VAE): Probabilistic latent space.
    - Denoising Autoencoder: Reconstruct from noisy input.

- **Pros**:
  - Captures complex, non-linear patterns.
  - Scales to high-dimensional data (e.g., images).
  - Flexible with deep architectures.
- **Cons**:
  - Needs normal-heavy data for training.
  - Compute-intensive, hard to tune.

**Example**:
- Task: Detect faulty machine parts.
- Autoencoder: Trained on normal images, flags high-error defects.

**Interview Tips**:
- Highlight error: “Anomalies don’t reconstruct well.”
- Link to ML: “Like unsupervised feature learning.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show encoder → bottleneck → decoder.”

## 6. What is the role of distance-based methods in anomaly detection?

**Answer**:

**Distance-based methods** identify anomalies as points far from others in feature space, assuming anomalies are isolated.

- **How They Work**:
  - **Distance Metric**: Compute distance (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
  - **Approaches**:
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**:
      - Compute distance to `k`-th nearest neighbor.
      - Threshold: High distance = anomaly.
    - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**:
      - Compare local density to neighbors’ density.
      - Score: High LOF = anomaly (lower density).
    - **Mahalanobis Distance**:
      - Use covariance: `D = √((x-μ)^T Σ^-1 (x-μ))`.
      - Flag high `D` as outliers.
  - **Thresholding**: Set cutoff (e.g., top 1% distances).

- **Role**:
  - **Identify Outliers**: Detect points in sparse regions.
  - **Handle Multivariate**: Account for feature correlations (e.g., Mahalanobis).
  - **Simple Intuition**: Anomalies are “far” from normal clusters.

- **Pros**:
  - Intuitive, no distribution assumptions.
  - Effective for low-to-moderate dimensions.
- **Cons**:
  - Scales poorly (`O(n²)` for k-NN).
  - Fails in high dimensions (curse of dimensionality).

**Example**:
- Data: User logins.
- k-NN: Flag login with high distance to 5th neighbor.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain density: “Anomalies live in empty spaces.”
- Mention limits: “High dimensions need preprocessing.”
- Be ready to compute: “Show Euclidean distance.”

## 7. How do you evaluate the performance of an anomaly detection model?

**Answer**:

Evaluating anomaly detection models is tricky due to imbalance (few anomalies) and lack of labels in unsupervised cases.

- **Metrics**:
  - **Supervised (Labeled Data)**:
    - **Precision/Recall/F1**:
      - Precision: `TP / (TP + FP)` (correct anomalies).
      - Recall: `TP / (TP + FN)` (found anomalies).
      - F1: `2 * (P * R) / (P + R)`.
    - **ROC-AUC**: Area under ROC curve (TPR vs. FPR).
    - **Use**: F1 for imbalance, AUC for threshold trade-offs.
  - **Unsupervised (No Labels)**:
    - **Reconstruction Error**: High error = anomaly (e.g., autoencoders).
    - **Distance/Score**: Rank points, evaluate top `k` (e.g., Isolation Forest).
    - **Use**: Compare to known anomalies if available.
  - **Precision@K**: Fraction of top `K` predictions that are anomalies.
    - **Use**: When only some anomalies are verified.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze TP, FP, TN, FN (supervised).
  - **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust cutoff to balance precision/recall.
  - **Visualization**: Plot scores, inspect outliers (e.g., t-SNE).
  - **Domain Feedback**: Validate with experts (e.g., fraud team).

- **Challenges**:
  - Imbalance: Few anomalies skew accuracy.
  - No Labels: Hard to quantify unsupervised performance.
  - Context: Anomalies vary by domain (e.g., fraud vs. sensor).

**Example**:
- Task: Detect network intrusions.
- Metrics: F1 = 0.7 (supervised), Precision@100 = 0.8 (unsupervised).

**Interview Tips**:
- Stress imbalance: “F1 over accuracy for rare anomalies.”
- Discuss unsupervised: “Use domain knowledge to validate.”
- Be ready to plot: “Show ROC curve.”

## 8. What are the challenges of anomaly detection in high-dimensional data?

**Answer**:

High-dimensional data poses unique challenges for anomaly detection:

- **Curse of Dimensionality**:
  - **Issue**: Distances become uniform, making outliers hard to spot.
  - **Fix**: Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
- **Sparsity**:
  - **Issue**: Data spreads thinly, reducing density differences.
  - **Fix**: Feature selection (e.g., remove low-variance features).
- **Computational Cost**:
  - **Issue**: Algorithms like k-NN scale poorly (`O(n²d)`).
  - **Fix**: Use approximate methods (e.g., random projections).
- **Irrelevant Features**:
  - **Issue**: Noise dilutes anomaly signals.
  - **Fix**: Feature engineering, robust stats (e.g., Mahalanobis).
- **Complex Patterns**:
  - **Issue**: Anomalies may only appear in subspaces.
  - **Fix**: Subspace clustering, deep methods (e.g., autoencoders).
- **Label Scarcity**:
  - **Issue**: High-dimensional data hard to label, limits supervised methods.
  - **Fix**: Unsupervised (e.g., Isolation Forest), semi-supervised.

**Example**:
- Data: 1000D image features.
- Challenge: k-NN slow, distances meaningless.
- Fix: PCA to 50D, run Isolation Forest.

**Interview Tips**:
- Highlight dimensionality: “Uniform distances kill detection.”
- Suggest fixes: “PCA or autoencoders help.”
- Be ready to explain: “Why high-D breaks k-NN.”
