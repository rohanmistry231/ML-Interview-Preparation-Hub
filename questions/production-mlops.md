## 1. What are the key challenges in deploying machine learning models to production?

**Answer**:

Deploying ML models to production involves several challenges:

- **Data Discrepancy**:
  - Training data may differ from production (e.g., missing features, different distributions).
  - **Fix**: Validate data pipelines, simulate production inputs during testing.
- **Scalability**:
  - Models may not handle high traffic or large datasets.
  - **Fix**: Optimize inference (e.g., quantization), use distributed systems.
- **Latency**:
  - Real-time applications require low-latency predictions.
  - **Fix**: Use lightweight models, caching, or edge deployment.
- **Reproducibility**:
  - Inconsistent results due to random seeds or environment differences.
  - **Fix**: Version code, data, and dependencies.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Hard to detect drift or degradation post-deployment.
  - **Fix**: Implement metrics for performance and data drift.
- **Security/Privacy**:
  - Models may leak sensitive data or be vulnerable to attacks (e.g., adversarial inputs).
  - **Fix**: Use differential privacy, robust input validation.
