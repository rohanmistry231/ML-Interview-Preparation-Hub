## 1. What are generative models, and how do they differ from discriminative models?

**Answer**:

- **Generative Models**:
  - **Definition**: Learn the joint probability distribution `P(X,Y)` or data distribution `P(X)` to generate new samples resembling the training data.
  - **Goal**: Model how data is created (e.g., generate images, text).
  - **How**: Capture underlying patterns to sample new instances.
  - **Examples**: GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, autoregressive models.
  - **Output**: New data (e.g., fake face image).
  - **Use Case**: Image synthesis, data augmentation.

- **Discriminative Models**:
  - **Definition**: Learn the conditional probability `P(Y|X)` to predict labels given input.
  - **Goal**: Classify or regress (e.g., label image as cat/dog).
  - **How**: Focus on decision boundaries between classes.
  - **Examples**: Logistic regression, SVM, CNNs for classification.
  - **Output**: Label or score (e.g., “dog” with 0.9).
  - **Use Case**: Classification, detection.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Distribution**:
    - Generative: Models `P(X)` or `P(X,Y)` (full data).
    - Discriminative: Models `P(Y|X)` (labels given data).
  - **Task**:
    - Generative: Create new data.
    - Discriminative: Predict labels.
  - **Complexity**:
    - Generative: Harder, needs data structure.
    - Discriminative: Simpler, focuses on boundaries.
  - **ML Context**: Generative for creation (e.g., art), discriminative for decisions (e.g., spam detection).

**Example**:
- Generative: VAE generates handwritten digits.
- Discriminative: CNN classifies digits as 0-9.

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify distributions: “Generative models P(X), discriminative P(Y|X).”
- Highlight tasks: “Generate vs. classify.”
- Be ready to compare: “Show cat image: generate vs. label.”

## 2. What is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and how does it work?

**Answer**:

A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a generative model that combines neural networks with Bayesian inference to learn a latent representation of data and generate new samples.

- **How It Works**:
  - **Architecture**:
    - **Encoder**: Maps input `x` to latent distribution `q(z|x)` (mean `μ`, variance `σ²`).
    - **Latent Space**: Sample `z ~ N(μ, σ²)` using reparameterization (e.g., `z = μ + σ * ε`, `ε ~ N(0,1)`).
    - **Decoder**: Maps `z` to reconstructed `p(x|z)`.
  - **Objective**:
    - Minimize loss: `L = Reconstruction Loss + KL Divergence`.
    - **Reconstruction**: `E[log p(x|z)]` (e.g., MSE for images).
    - **KL Divergence**: `D_KL(q(z|x) || p(z))`, regularizes `q(z|x)` to `p(z) ~ N(0,1)`.
  - **Training**:
    - Optimize via gradient descent.
    - Sample `z` to generate new data.
  - **Generation**:
    - Sample `z ~ N(0,1)`, pass through decoder.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Probabilistic**: Latent `z` follows distribution, enables sampling.
  - **Regularized**: KL term ensures smooth latent space.
  - **Continuous**: Interpolates between data points.

- **Pros**:
  - Stable training (vs. GANs).
  - Interpretable latent space.
- **Cons**:
  - Blurry outputs (due to MSE loss).
  - Limited quality vs. GANs.

**Example**:
- Task: Generate faces.
- VAE: Encodes face to `z`, decodes to similar face.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain components: “Encoder, latent, decoder.”
- Highlight KL: “Regularizes for smooth sampling.”
- Be ready to derive: “Show VAE loss function.”

## 3. Explain the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Answer**:

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** are generative models where two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—compete in a game to produce realistic data.

- **How They Work**:
  - **Generator (G)**:
    - Input: Random noise `z ~ p(z)` (e.g., `N(0,1)`).
    - Output: Fake data `G(z)` (e.g., image).
    - Goal: Fool discriminator.
  - **Discriminator (D)**:
    - Input: Real data `x` or fake `G(z)`.
    - Output: Probability `D(x)` (real) or `D(G(z))` (fake).
    - Goal: Distinguish real vs. fake.
  - **Training**:
    - **Loss** (min-max game):
      - `min_G max_D E[log D(x)] + E[log (1 - D(G(z)))]`.
      - D maximizes correct classification.
      - G minimizes D’s ability to spot fakes.
    - Alternate updates:
      - Train D to improve detection.
      - Train G to reduce `1 - D(G(z))`.
  - **Equilibrium**: G produces data indistinguishable from real (`D(x) ≈ D(G(z)) ≈ 0.5`).

- **Key Features**:
  - **Adversarial**: Competition drives quality.
  - **Flexible**: No explicit distribution modeling.
  - **High-Quality**: Sharp, realistic outputs.

**Example**:
- Task: Generate art.
- GAN: G creates paintings, D critiques vs. real art.

**Interview Tips**:
- Use game analogy: “Generator fakes, discriminator judges.”
- Highlight loss: “Min-max balances both.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show G → D pipeline.”

## 4. What are the challenges in training GANs, and how can they be addressed?

**Answer**:

Training GANs is notoriously difficult due to their adversarial nature. Common challenges and fixes:

- **Challenges**:
  - **Mode Collapse**:
    - **Issue**: Generator produces limited variety (e.g., same face).
    - **Fix**:
      - Use Wasserstein GAN (WGAN): Replace loss with Earth Mover’s distance.
      - Mini-batch discrimination: Encourage diversity.
  - **Non-Convergence**:
    - **Issue**: G and D oscillate, no equilibrium.
    - **Fix**:
      - Gradient penalty (WGAN-GP): Stabilize training.
      - Label smoothing: Soften D’s targets (e.g., 0.9 vs. 1).
  - **Vanishing Gradients**:
    - **Issue**: D too strong, G gets no signal.
    - **Fix**:
      - Use leaky ReLU in D.
      - Alternate training steps (e.g., train D once, G twice).
  - **Training Imbalance**:
    - **Issue**: D or G dominates, halting progress.
    - **Fix**:
      - Balance learning rates (e.g., lower for D).
      - Monitor losses to adjust steps.
  - **High Compute**:
    - **Issue**: Deep GANs need GPUs, long training.
    - **Fix**: Use progressive growing (e.g., start small, scale up).

- **General Tips**:
  - Normalize inputs (e.g., [-1,1] for images).
  - Use stable architectures (e.g., DCGAN).
  - Monitor generated samples visually.

**Example**:
- Problem: GAN generates same dog breed.
- Fix: Add WGAN loss, diversity improves.

**Interview Tips**:
- Prioritize mode collapse: “Biggest GAN headache.”
- Suggest fixes: “WGAN-GP is go-to stabilizer.”
- Be ready to debug: “Describe training loss curves.”

## 5. What is a diffusion model, and how does it generate data?

**Answer**:

**Diffusion models** are generative models that learn to reverse a noise-adding process to generate data from random noise, producing high-quality outputs.

- **How They Work**:
  - **Forward Process** (Noise Addition):
    - Start with data `x_0` (e.g., image).
    - Add Gaussian noise over `T` steps: `x_t = √(1-β_t) * x_{t-1} + √β_t * ε`.
    - `β_t`: Noise schedule (increases with `t`).
    - End: `x_T ~ N(0,1)` (pure noise).
  - **Reverse Process** (Denoising):
    - Learn to reverse: `p(x_{t-1}|x_t) = N(μ_θ(x_t, t), Σ_θ(x_t, t))`.
    - Train model (e.g., U-Net) to predict noise `ε_θ(x_t, t)`.
    - Objective: Minimize `E[||ε - ε_θ(x_t, t)||²]`.
  - **Generation**:
    - Start with noise `x_T ~ N(0,1)`.
    - Iteratively denoise `x_{t-1} ← model(x_t, t)` for `T` steps.
    - Output: `x_0` (generated data).

- **Key Features**:
  - **Iterative**: Multiple denoising steps (vs. GAN’s single pass).
  - **High-Quality**: Matches or beats GANs.
  - **Stable**: No adversarial training.

- **Pros**:
  - Robust training, no mode collapse.
  - Excellent for images, audio.
- **Cons**:
  - Slow generation (100s of steps).
  - High compute for training.

**Example**:
- Task: Generate faces.
- Diffusion: Denoises random noise to sharp face over 1000 steps.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain process: “Noise to data via learned reversal.”
- Highlight quality: “Rivals GANs, more stable.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show forward/reverse steps.”

## 6. What is the difference between VAE and GAN in terms of output quality and training?

**Answer**:

- **Output Quality**:
  - **VAE**:
    - **Characteristics**: Often blurry, less detailed.
    - **Reason**: MSE reconstruction loss smooths outputs, KL regularization limits expressiveness.
    - **Example**: Generated faces look soft, lack fine textures.
    - **Use Case**: When interpretability > sharpness (e.g., latent interpolation).
  - **GAN**:
    - **Characteristics**: Sharp, realistic, high-fidelity.
    - **Reason**: Adversarial loss optimizes for perceptual similarity, not pixel-wise error.
    - **Example**: Generated faces have crisp details (e.g., eyes, hair).
    - **Use Case**: Photorealistic synthesis (e.g., art, deepfakes).

- **Training**:
  - **VAE**:
    - **Process**: Optimize single loss (`Reconstruction + KL`) with gradient descent.
    - **Stability**: Converges reliably, no competing objectives.
    - **Speed**: Faster, simpler optimization.
    - **Challenges**: Balancing reconstruction vs. KL, tuning latent size.
  - **GAN**:
    - **Process**: Min-max game between G and D, alternating updates.
    - **Stability**: Prone to mode collapse, non-convergence.
    - **Speed**: Slower, needs careful tuning (e.g., learning rates).
    - **Challenges**: Balancing G/D, avoiding vanishing gradients.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Quality**: GANs > VAEs (sharper but riskier).
  - **Training**: VAEs easier, GANs trickier.
  - **Latent Space**: VAEs structured (Gaussian); GANs unstructured (noise).
  - **ML Context**: VAEs for stable tasks, GANs for high-quality visuals.

**Example**:
- VAE: Generates blurry digits, trains in 1 hour.
- GAN: Generates sharp digits, trains in 3 hours with tuning.

**Interview Tips**:
- Contrast outputs: “VAE blurry, GAN crisp.”
- Discuss stability: “VAE trains smoothly, GAN fights.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show VAE vs. GAN loss.”

## 7. How do you evaluate the performance of generative models?

**Answer**:

Evaluating generative models is challenging due to subjective quality and lack of direct metrics. Common approaches:

- **Quantitative Metrics**:
  - **Inception Score (IS)**:
    - **How**: Use pretrained classifier (e.g., InceptionV3) to score diversity and clarity.
    - **Pros**: Correlates with human judgment.
    - **Cons**: Biased to classifier’s domain.
  - **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**:
    - **How**: Compare feature distributions (real vs. fake) via InceptionV3.
    - **Formula**: `FID = ||μ_r - μ_g||² + Tr(Σ_r + Σ_g - 2(Σ_r Σ_g)^0.5)`.
    - **Pros**: Sensitive to quality, diversity.
    - **Cons**: Needs large samples, domain-specific.
  - **Precision/Recall**:
    - **How**: Measure coverage (recall) and fidelity (precision) of generated data.
    - **Pros**: Balances mode collapse vs. quality.
    - **Cons**: Complex to compute.
  - **Log-Likelihood** (VAEs, diffusion):
    - **How**: Estimate `log p(x)` for generated data.
    - **Cons**: Doesn’t reflect perceptual quality.

- **Qualitative Evaluation**:
  - **Human Judgment**:
    - Score samples for realism, diversity (e.g., 1-5 scale).
    - **Use**: Gold standard for creative tasks.
  - **Visual Inspection**:
    - Check samples for artifacts, variety.
    - **Use**: Debug mode collapse, blurriness.
  - **Interpolation**:
    - Test latent space (e.g., smooth transitions in VAEs).
    - **Use**: Assess structure, generalization.

- **Task-Specific**:
  - **Downstream Tasks**: Use generated data for classification, measure accuracy.
  - **Domain Metrics**: PSNR/SSIM for images, BLEU for text.

- **Challenges**:
  - **Subjectivity**: Metrics vs. human perception misalign.
  - **Diversity vs. Quality**: Hard to balance (e.g., FID misses modes).
  - **Compute**: FID needs many samples.

**Example**:
- Task: Generate faces.
- Metrics: FID = 10 (good), IS = 3.5 (decent).
- Visual: Check for diverse expressions.

**Interview Tips**:
- Prioritize FID: “Best for image quality.”
- Mention limits: “Metrics don’t capture everything.”
- Be ready to compute: “Explain FID formula.”
