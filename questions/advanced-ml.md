## 1. What is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm?

**Answer**:

The **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum likelihood estimates in probabilistic models with latent variables.

- **How It Works**:
  1. **Expectation (E) Step**:
     - Compute expected log-likelihood of the complete data (observed + latent), given current parameters.
     - Estimate posterior probabilities of latent variables (e.g., `P(z|x, θ)`).
  2. **Maximization (M) Step**:
     - Update parameters (`θ`) to maximize the expected log-likelihood.
     - Solve for `θ` using closed-form or optimization.
  3. **Iterate**: Repeat E and M steps until convergence (likelihood stabilizes).

- **Use Cases**:
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Cluster data with latent cluster assignments.
  - Hidden Markov Models: Infer hidden states.
  - Missing Data: Impute values in incomplete datasets.

- **Math**:
  - Maximize `log P(x|θ) = log Σ_z P(x,z|θ)`.
  - E-Step: Compute `Q(θ|θ_t) = E[log P(x,z|θ) | x, θ_t]`.
  - M-Step: `θ_{t+1} = argmax_θ Q(θ|θ_t)`.

**Example**:
- Task: Cluster customers into 3 groups.
- EM: E-Step estimates cluster probabilities; M-Step updates Gaussian parameters.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain intuition: “EM guesses latent variables, then refines parameters.”
- Mention convergence: “Guaranteed to increase likelihood.”
- Be ready to derive: “Show E-Step for GMM.”

## 2. Can you explain Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)?

**Answer**:

**Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** are probabilistic models for sequential data, where observed data depends on hidden states that follow a Markov process.

- **Components**:
  - **Hidden States**: Unobserved variables (e.g., weather: sunny, rainy).
  - **Observations**: Observed data tied to states (e.g., activities: walk, shop).
  - **Transition Probabilities**: `P(z_t | z_{t-1})` (state changes).
  - **Emission Probabilities**: `P(x_t | z_t)` (observation given state).
  - **Initial Probabilities**: `P(z_1)` (starting state).

- **Key Algorithms**:
  - **Forward-Backward**: Compute likelihood and posterior `P(z_t | x_1:T)`.
  - **Viterbi**: Find most likely state sequence `argmax_z P(z | x)`.
  - **Baum-Welch**: Train HMM parameters using EM.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Speech recognition: Map audio to phonemes.
  - NLP: Part-of-speech tagging.
  - Bioinformatics: Gene sequence modeling.

**Example**:
- Task: Predict weather from activities.
- HMM: Hidden states (sunny/rainy), observations (walk/shop), learns transitions/emissions.

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify Markov property: “Next state depends only on current.”
- Mention algorithms: “Viterbi for decoding, Baum-Welch for training.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show states → observations.”

## 3. What is the difference between variational inference and MCMC?

**Answer**:

- **Variational Inference (VI)**:
  - **How**: Approximates posterior `P(z|x)` by optimizing a simpler distribution `q(z)` to minimize KL divergence.
  - **Process**:
    - Choose a family of distributions (e.g., Gaussian).
    - Optimize `q(z)` to match `P(z|x)` via ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound).
    - Use gradient-based methods (e.g., mean-field VI).
  - **Pros**: Fast, scalable, deterministic.
  - **Cons**: Approximates (may miss modes), limited by `q(z)` family.

- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**:
  - **How**: Samples from posterior `P(z|x)` using a Markov chain that converges to the target distribution.
  - **Process**:
    - Propose samples (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs).
    - Accept/reject based on `P(z|x)`.
    - Collect samples to approximate posterior.
  - **Pros**: Asymptotically exact, captures full distribution.
  - **Cons**: Slow, computationally expensive, convergence issues.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Approach**: VI optimizes approximation; MCMC samples directly.
  - **Speed**: VI is faster; MCMC is slower but more accurate.
  - **Output**: VI gives `q(z)`; MCMC gives samples.
  - **Use Case**: VI for large-scale (e.g., VAE); MCMC for small, precise models (e.g., Bayesian regression).

**Example**:
- VI: Train VAE for image generation (fast).
- MCMC: Estimate parameters in small Bayesian model (exact).

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain trade-offs: “VI sacrifices accuracy for speed.”
- Mention ELBO: “VI maximizes a lower bound.”
- Be ready to compare: “MCMC for precision, VI for scale.”

## 4. What are Gaussian Processes and when would you use them?

**Answer**:

**Gaussian Processes (GPs)** are probabilistic models that define a distribution over functions, used for regression and classification.

- **How They Work**:
  - **Definition**: A GP is a collection of random variables where any finite subset follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
  - **Components**:
    - **Mean Function**: `m(x)` (often 0).
    - **Kernel Function**: `k(x, x’)` (e.g., RBF) measures similarity, defines covariance.
  - **Prediction**: Given training data `(X, y)`, predict `y*` for new `x*` using conditional Gaussian:
    - `P(y*|X, y, x*) ~ N(K_*,K^-1y, K_** - K_*,K^-1K_*^T)`.
  - **Uncertainty**: Provides confidence intervals.

- **When to Use**:
  - **Small Datasets**: GPs excel with limited data (e.g., <1000 points).
  - **Uncertainty Quantification**: Need predictive uncertainty (e.g., finance, robotics).
  - **Non-Linear Regression**: Model complex functions without specifying form.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used in Bayesian optimization.

- **Limitations**:
  - Scales poorly (`O(n³)` for `n` points).
  - Kernel choice impacts performance.

**Example**:
- Task: Predict temperature over time.
- GP: Models smooth trends with uncertainty bands.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain intuition: “GPs assume nearby points are similar.”
- Mention kernels: “RBF is common for smoothness.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show mean and uncertainty.”

## 5. What is Bayesian optimization and how does it work?

**Answer**:

**Bayesian optimization** is a method for optimizing expensive, black-box functions (e.g., hyperparameter tuning) by modeling the function with a surrogate and iteratively sampling.

- **How It Works**:
  1. **Surrogate Model**:
     - Use a probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian Process) to approximate the function `f(x)`.
     - Model predicts mean and uncertainty for any `x`.
  2. **Acquisition Function**:
     - Choose next point to evaluate (e.g., Expected Improvement, Probability of Improvement).
     - Balances exploration (high uncertainty) and exploitation (high predicted value).
  3. **Update**:
     - Evaluate `f(x)` at chosen point.
     - Update surrogate with new data.
  4. **Repeat**: Iterate until budget exhausted or convergence.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, layers).
  - Experimental design (e.g., drug trials).
  - Robotics (e.g., tune control parameters).

- **Advantages**:
  - Sample-efficient (few evaluations).
  - Handles noisy functions.
  - Models uncertainty.

**Example**:
- Task: Tune neural network learning rate.
- BO: Tests rates, models accuracy, finds optimal rate in 10 trials.

**Interview Tips**:
- Emphasize efficiency: “Ideal for costly functions.”
- Explain acquisition: “Decides where to sample next.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show GP and acquisition function.”

## 6. Can you explain the concept of causal inference in machine learning?

**Answer**:

**Causal inference** aims to identify cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., “Does X cause Y?”) rather than just correlations, critical for decision-making.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Causal Effect**: Difference in outcome `Y` with vs. without treatment `X` (e.g., `E[Y|X=1] - E[Y|X=0]`).
  - **Confounding**: Variables affecting both `X` and `Y`, biasing estimates.
  - **Counterfactuals**: What would `Y` be if `X` were different?

- **Methods**:
  - **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**: Randomize `X` to eliminate confounders.
  - **Observational Studies**:
    - **Propensity Score Matching**: Match treated/control units by probability of treatment.
    - **Instrumental Variables**: Use external variable affecting `X` but not `Y`.
    - **Difference-in-Differences**: Compare trends before/after treatment.
  - **Causal Graphs**: Use DAGs to model relationships (e.g., Pearl’s do-calculus).

- **Use Cases**:
  - Marketing: Does ad campaign increase sales?
  - Healthcare: Does drug improve outcomes?
  - Policy: Does training program boost employment?

**Example**:
- Task: Does training increase earnings?
- Method: Match trained/untrained workers by age, education; estimate effect.

**Interview Tips**:

## 8. What is the concept of federated learning?

**Answer**:

**Federated learning** is a decentralized ML approach where models are trained across multiple devices/servers without sharing raw data, preserving privacy.

- **How It Works**:
  1. **Local Training**:
     - Each device (e.g., phone) trains a model on its local data.
  2. **Aggregation**:
     - Devices send model updates (e.g., gradients, weights) to a central server.
     - Server aggregates updates (e.g., weighted average) to update global model.
  3. **Distribution**:
     - Global model sent back to devices for next round.
  4. **Repeat**: Iterate until convergence.

- **Key Features**:

  - **Process**:
    - Train initial model on small labeled set.
    - Query unlabeled samples (e.g., highest uncertainty, diversity).
    - Human labels selected samples, retrain.
  - **Pros**: Reduces labeling effort, targets hard cases.
  - **Cons**: Requires human-in-loop, query strategy matters.
  - **Use Case**: Medical imaging (label only ambiguous scans).

- **Semi-Supervised Learning**:
  - **How**: Uses small labeled dataset and large unlabeled dataset to improve model, leveraging unlabeled structure.
  - **Process**:
    - Train on labeled data.
    - Predict pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.
    - Retrain on combined labeled + pseudo-labeled data.
  - **Pros**: Utilizes abundant unlabeled data, no human needed post-initial labeling.
  - **Cons**: Pseudo-label noise, assumes labeled/unlabeled similarity.
  - **Use Case**: Text classification with few labeled documents.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Labeling**: Active learning queries new labels; semi-supervised uses existing + pseudo-labels.
  - **Human Effort**: Active requires ongoing human input; semi-supervised is autonomous.
  - **Goal**: Active minimizes labeling; semi-supervised maximizes unlabeled use.
