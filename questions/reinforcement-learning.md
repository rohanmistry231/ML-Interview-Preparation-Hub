## 1. What is reinforcement learning, and how does it differ from supervised learning?

**Answer**:

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, maximizing cumulative rewards through trial and error.

- **How RL Works**:
  - **Components**:
    - Agent: Decision-maker.
    - Environment: System agent interacts with.
    - State (s): Current situation.
    - Action (a): Choice made by agent.
    - Reward (r): Feedback from environment.
  - **Goal**: Learn policy `π(a|s)` to maximize expected reward `E[Σ γ^t r_t]`, where `γ` is discount factor.
  - **Process**: Agent explores, observes rewards, updates policy.

- **Vs. Supervised Learning**:
  - **Data**:
    - RL: No labeled dataset; learns from rewards.
    - Supervised: Labeled input-output pairs.
  - **Feedback**:
    - RL: Delayed, sparse rewards.
    - Supervised: Immediate error (e.g., loss).
  - **Goal**:
    - RL: Optimize long-term reward.
    - Supervised: Minimize prediction error.
  - **Exploration**:
    - RL: Balances exploration/exploitation.
    - Supervised: Uses fixed dataset.
  - **Use Case**:
    - RL: Robotics, games.
    - Supervised: Classification, regression.

**Example**:
- RL: Train robot to walk (reward for steps).
- Supervised: Predict house prices (labeled data).

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify feedback: “RL learns from rewards, not labels.”
- Highlight exploration: “Unique to RL.”
- Be ready to compare: “Show RL vs. supervised task.”

## 2. What is a Markov Decision Process (MDP)?

**Answer**:

A **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making under uncertainty, foundational to RL.

- **Components**:
  - **States (S)**: Set of possible situations (e.g., game board).
  - **Actions (A)**: Choices available (e.g., move left).
  - **Transition Probability**: `P(s'|s,a)` (probability of next state).
  - **Reward Function**: `R(s,a,s')` (reward for action).
  - **Discount Factor (γ)**: `0 ≤ γ ≤ 1`, balances immediate vs. future rewards.
  - **Policy (π)**: `π(a|s)`, strategy mapping states to actions.

- **Markov Property**:
  - Future depends only on current state: `P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t) = P(s_{t+1}|s_1,...,s_t,a_1,...,a_t)`.

- **Goal**:
  - Find optimal policy `π*` to maximize expected return: `E[Σ γ^t r_t]`.

- **RL Context**:
  - MDPs formalize environments (e.g., robot navigation).
  - Algorithms (e.g., Q-learning) solve MDPs.

**Example**:
- MDP: Chess game.
  - States: Board positions.
  - Actions: Legal moves.
  - Rewards: +1 for win, 0 else.
  - Policy: Choose best move.

**Interview Tips**:
- List components: “States, actions, rewards, transitions.”
- Stress Markov: “Only current state matters.”
- Be ready to model: “Define MDP for a simple game.”

## 3. Explain the difference between value-based and policy-based RL methods

**Answer**:

- **Value-Based Methods**:
  - **How**: Learn value function to estimate expected rewards.
    - State value: `V(s) = E[Σ γ^t r_t | s]`.
    - Action value: `Q(s,a) = E[Σ γ^t r_t | s,a]`.
  - **Policy**: Derived implicitly (e.g., `π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)`).
  - **Examples**:
    - Q-learning: Update `Q` table.
    - Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Approximate `Q` with neural net.
  - **Pros**:
    - Stable for discrete actions.
    - Converges well with enough data.
  - **Cons**:
    - Struggles with continuous actions.
    - Overestimates values (e.g., max bias).
  - **Use Case**: Games (e.g., Atari).

- **Policy-Based Methods**:
  - **How**: Directly learn policy `π(a|s;θ)` parameterized by `θ`.
    - Optimize: Maximize `J(θ) = E[Σ γ^t r_t]` via gradient ascent.
  - **Examples**:
    - REINFORCE: Policy gradient.
    - PPO: Constrained policy updates.
  - **Pros**:
    - Handles continuous actions.
    - Better for stochastic policies.
  - **Cons**:
    - High variance in gradients.
    - Slower convergence.
  - **Use Case**: Robotics (e.g., arm control).

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Learning**:
    - Value: Estimate `V` or `Q`, derive `π`.
    - Policy: Optimize `π` directly.
  - **Output**:
    - Value: Action scores.
    - Policy: Action probabilities.
  - **Action Space**:
    - Value: Discrete-friendly.
    - Policy: Continuous-friendly.
  - **ML Context**: Value for games, policy for control.

**Example**:
- Value: DQN picks best chess move.
- Policy: PPO learns robot walking gait.

**Interview Tips**:
- Clarify approach: “Value indirect, policy direct.”
- Discuss trade-offs: “Value for discrete, policy for continuous.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show Q-table vs. policy net.”

## 4. What is Q-learning, and how does it work?

**Answer**:

**Q-learning** is a model-free, value-based RL algorithm that learns an action-value function `Q(s,a)` to find the optimal policy.

- **How It Works**:
  - **Goal**: Estimate `Q(s,a) = E[Σ γ^t r_t | s,a]`.
  - **Update Rule** (Bellman equation):
    - `Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α * [r + γ * max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]`.
    - `α`: Learning rate.
    - `r`: Reward.
    - `γ`: Discount factor.
    - `s'`: Next state.
  - **Process**:
    1. Initialize `Q` (e.g., zeros).
    2. Choose action (e.g., ε-greedy).
    3. Observe `r`, `s'`.
    4. Update `Q`.
    5. Repeat until convergence.
  - **Policy**: `π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)`.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Off-Policy**: Learns optimal `Q` regardless of exploration.
  - **Tabular**: Stores `Q` for discrete states/actions.
  - **Convergence**: Guaranteed for finite MDPs with proper `α`, `ε`.

- **Pros**:
  - Simple, effective for small problems.
  - Model-free, no environment knowledge needed.
- **Cons**:
  - Scales poorly (large state/action spaces).
  - Slow for complex tasks.

**Example**:
- Task: Navigate gridworld.
- Q-learning: Updates `Q` for each move, learns path to goal.

**Interview Tips**:
- Explain update: “Q moves toward reward + future value.”
- Highlight off-policy: “Learns even with random actions.”
- Be ready to code: “Show Q-table update.”

## 5. What is the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL?

**Answer**:

The **exploration-exploitation trade-off** is the balance between trying new actions (exploration) to learn better policies and choosing known high-reward actions (exploitation).

- **Exploration**:
  - **Why**: Discover unknown states/rewards.
  - **Risk**: Waste time on poor actions.
  - **Methods**:
    - ε-greedy: Random action with probability `ε`.
    - Softmax: Sample based on `Q` scores.
    - UCB: Prioritize uncertainty.
- **Exploitation**:
  - **Why**: Maximize immediate reward.
  - **Risk**: Miss better long-term policies.
  - **Method**: Choose `argmax_a Q(s,a)` or highest `π(a|s)`.

- **Balancing**:
  - **ε-Greedy**: Start with high `ε` (e.g., 0.1), decay over time.
  - **Annealing**: Reduce exploration as learning stabilizes.
  - **Intrinsic Rewards**: Add curiosity bonuses.
  - **ML Context**: Critical for RL convergence (e.g., DQN, PPO).

**Example**:
- Game: Slot machines.
- Exploit: Pull known best arm.
- Explore: Try new arms to find better.

**Interview Tips**:
- Use analogy: “Like choosing a new restaurant vs. favorite.”
- Discuss decay: “Exploration fades as Q improves.”
- Be ready to suggest: “ε-greedy is simple baseline.”

## 6. What is the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm?

**Answer**:

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is a policy-based RL algorithm that balances sample efficiency, stability, and performance, widely used in complex tasks.

- **How It Works**:
  - **Policy Gradient**:
    - Optimize `π(a|s;θ)` to maximize `J(θ) = E[Σ γ^t r_t]`.
    - Gradient: `∇J ≈ Σ ∇_θ log π(a|s;θ) * A`, where `A` is advantage.
  - **Clipped Objective**:
    - Limit policy updates to avoid large changes.
    - Objective: `L = E[min(r_t * A, clip(r_t, 1-ε, 1+ε) * A)]`.
    - `r_t = π_θ(a|s) / π_old(a|s)`, `ε` (e.g., 0.2) bounds ratio.
  - **Advantage**:
    - Estimate `A = Q(s,a) - V(s)` using value function `V`.
  - **Process**:
    1. Collect trajectories with current `π`.
    2. Compute advantages.
    3. Optimize clipped objective (multiple epochs).
    4. Update `π`, repeat.

- **Why Popular**:
  - **Stability**: Clipping prevents destructive updates.
  - **Efficiency**: Reuses samples, good for on-policy.
  - **Versatility**: Works for discrete/continuous actions.
  - **ML Context**: Standard for robotics, games (e.g., OpenAI).

**Example**:
- Task: Train robot arm.
- PPO: Learns smooth motions, avoids wild swings.

**Interview Tips**:
- Highlight clipping: “Keeps updates safe.”
- Compare: “Vs. TRPO: simpler, still robust.”
- Be ready to sketch: “Show clipped vs. unclipped loss.”

## 7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of model-based vs. model-free RL?

**Answer**:

- **Model-Based RL**:
  - **How**: Learn model of environment (`P(s'|s,a)`, `R(s,a)`), plan actions.
  - **Examples**: AlphaZero, MuZero.
  - **Advantages**:
    - **Sample Efficiency**: Simulate transitions, need fewer real samples.
    - **Planning**: Optimize over predicted futures.
    - **Transferable**: Model reusable across tasks.
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - **Model Errors**: Inaccurate models hurt performance.
    - **Complexity**: Hard to learn dynamics for complex environments.
    - **Compute**: Planning can be slow (e.g., tree search).
  - **Use Case**: Games with clear rules (e.g., chess).

- **Model-Free RL**:
  - **How**: Learn policy/value directly from experience, no environment model.
  - **Examples**: DQN, PPO.
  - **Advantages**:
    - **Simplicity**: No need to model complex dynamics.
    - **Robustness**: Works with real-world noise.
    - **Scalable**: Easier for high-dimensional tasks.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Model**: Model-based learns dynamics; model-free doesn’t.
  - **Efficiency**: Model-based uses fewer samples; model-free needs more.
  - **Complexity**: Model-based harder to implement; model-free simpler.
  - **ML Context**: Model-free dominates (e.g., PPO); model-based for structured tasks.

**Example**:
- Model-Based: Simulate chess moves.
- Model-Free: Learn moves via trial and error.

**Interview Tips**:
- Stress efficiency: “Model-based saves samples.”
- Discuss limits: “Model errors kill planning.”
- Be ready to compare: “Show sample needs.”

## 8. How do you evaluate the performance of a reinforcement learning agent?

**Answer**:

Evaluating an RL agent measures its ability to maximize rewards and generalize across environments.

- **Metrics**:
  - **Cumulative Reward**:
    - Sum of rewards: `Σ r_t` or discounted `Σ γ^t r_t`.
    - **Use**: Primary metric, shows policy quality.
  - **Average Reward**:
    - Mean reward per episode or step.
    - **Use**: Stabilizes noisy rewards.
  - **Success Rate**:
    - Fraction of episodes achieving goal (e.g., win game).
    - **Use**: Task-specific (e.g., robot reaches target).
  - **Convergence**:
    - Track value/policy stability (e.g., `Q` changes).
    - **Use**: Assess learning progress.
  - **Exploration Metrics**:
    - Measure exploration (e.g., entropy of `π`).
    - **Use**: Ensure balance with exploitation.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Test Policy**:
    - Run `π` greedily (no exploration) on test environment.
    - Average rewards over episodes (e.g., 100 runs).
  - **Benchmarking**:
    - Compare to baselines (e.g., random, human, prior algorithms).
  - **Robustness**:
    - Test on varied environments (e.g., different dynamics).
  - **Visualization**:
    - Plot reward curves, state visits, or actions.
  - **Statistical Analysis**:
    - Confidence intervals for rewards (e.g., mean ± std dev).

- **Challenges**:
  - **Noise**: Rewards vary (e.g., random environments).
  - **Partial Observability**: Hard to assess in POMDPs.
  - **Long Horizons**: Delayed rewards skew metrics.

**Example**:
- Task: Train game agent.
- Metrics: Avg reward = 500, success rate = 80%.
- Analysis: Plot reward curve to confirm convergence.

**Interview Tips**:
- Prioritize rewards: “Cumulative reward is king.”
- Discuss robustness: “Test on new environments.”
- Be ready to plot: “Show reward vs. episode.”
